### What is DeepSite?
DeepSite – is a free AI-powered website builder with open-source code, hosted on Hugging Face, that allows you to create and edit fully functional multi-page websites using natural language. It is powered by DeepSeek models and uses a differential patching approach to make fast and precise changes. DeepSite can generate and clone websites and then lets you edit them interactively in the browser. Since it is an open-source project, you can use it on your own GitHub repository.

### What does this repo represent?
This project contains a system prompt for DeepSeek models, to create full-fledged Web Applications with just one query to the model. This prompt is literally a paradise for vibecoders, since you don’t have to write 10+ requests to fix or add features. The system instructions already indicate what models need to be added to your web application.

### What is this for?
This system prompt is needed for better website generation using AI. DeepSeek series models They understand this context perfectly and generate the best code, which is why this Prompt is written for these same models. You can use this Prompt as much as you like, in any chats. Unlike a typical request to create a web app, our Prompt includes: the perfect structure, the perfect style, and adaptations for phones, optimization and more!

### Instructions for use:
1. Copy repo for git:
